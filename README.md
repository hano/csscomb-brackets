# CSScomb Brackets plugin

Implementation of [CSScomp](https://github.com/csscomb/csscomb.js) for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Credits to [CSScomb](https://github.com/csscomb) - thanks for the great work.

## Usage
You can use the plugin in three different ways:

1. Contextmenu on the Sidebar

	Using the CSScomb from the sidebar will update the selected file or folder directly

2. File->CSScomb on the Sidebar

	If there is a text selection, only the text selection will be updated. If there is no text selection the selected file or folder gets updated.

3. Editor Contextmenu or `CMD+ALT+c`

	If there is a text selection, only the text selection will be updated. If there is no text selection the selected file or folder gets updated.
	
## Error handling
The statusbar will update the tooltip if something happens. Just hold you mouse a while over the icon in the statusbar.
